                <h4>ACKNOWLEDGE IMPOSTER SYNDROME (then kick it to the curb!)</h4>
                <p>When you're a newbie, it's easy to listen to that little voice in the back of your mind that tells you that it's too hard, you can't do this, you'll never get a job, blah, blah, blah.</p>

                <p>Sometimes it's a niggling doubt, other times a screaming howler monkey!</p>

                <p>The way to become an expert is to keep at it, try new things, make mistakes, ask for help.  Albert Einstein struggled with math as a schoolboy and look how he turned out!</p>

                <p></p>

                <h4>DO THE WORK!</h4>

                <p>Learning a new language is challenging and you need to practice, practice, rinse and repeat EVERY single day until you become fluent. </p>

                <p>We all lead busy lives and balancing work, family, school (or all of the above) can be a real challenge.  I've found that if I go more than a day without doing some kind of coding practice, rereading class notes, listening to a podcast etc., then when it's time to work on a project, it's a struggle.</p>

                <p>You can do this!</p>
